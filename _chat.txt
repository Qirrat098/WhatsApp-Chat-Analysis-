[1/29/25, 7:07:09 PM] Mahnoor Ahmed GD: Hey everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to share that I am stepping down from my role as the administrator of our DataCamp community. After a year and a half of dedication to this initiative, it’s a bittersweet moment for me.

Building this space alongside all of you has been an incredibly fulfilling journey. From curating learning opportunities to ensuring that every member had access to valuable resources, I’ve always strived to make this community a supportive and enriching environment. Seeing so many of you grow, collaborate, and make the most of this platform has been the biggest reward.

As I step away, the administration of DataCamp operations will now be handled by Umer Noor and Sualeha Junaid. I hope you continue to engage, learn, and make the most of this community under their guidance.

While I may no longer be managing things on the admin side, I truly hope the spirit of this community continues to thrive. Thank you to everyone who made this experience so meaningful—I’ve learned just as much from you as you have from DataCamp! Wishing you all continued success in your learning journeys.

This isn’t goodbye, just a change of roles. Keep learning and keep growing! 

Best,
Mahnoor

[1/29/25, 11:37:52 PM] ~ Dan: I'd like to ask something from the admins,
Mahnoor has stepped down from the role but
I wonder why such a brilliant and helpful person has been removed from the group?
[1/29/25, 11:47:52 PM] ~ Shahzaib: People who already have access should apply again as well?
[1/29/25, 11:56:34 PM] Datacamp GDGoc@DSU: ‎You changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group
[1/29/25, 11:59:31 PM] Qirrat: Thank you for sharing your kind words and appreciation for Mahnoor’s contributions. She has truly been an integral part of GDG and has made a significant impact with her hard work and dedication ❤️ 

As an organization, we respect the privacy and confidentiality of our team members, and therefore, we refrain from discussing internal matters publicly. We wish Mahnoor all the best in her future endeavors and are confident she will continue to achieve great things.

[4/21/25, 9:53:07 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Hello!

We’ll soon be opening up new registrations for DataCamp. However, before that happens, we need to revoke inactive accounts to make room for active users.

If you haven’t started using the platform yet, you have about a week to get involved and commit to it. Otherwise, your account will be deactivated.

Make sure to log in and start learning to retain your access!

Regards,
Umer Noor

[5/22/25, 2:44:11 PM] ~ Saifullah Khan: My subscription has expired.
[5/22/25, 2:58:00 PM] ~ 🔕: Is completing the course mandatory?

Actually I'm more interested in business intelligence for now, so would be working on Tableau and PowerBI courses
[5/22/25, 3:01:41 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Thanks for letting me know
that’s totally fine!
The Deep Learning course isn’t mandatory, it’s more of a general upskilling opportunity for anyone interested.
[5/22/25, 3:02:02 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Since you're focused on Business Intelligence, working on Tableau and Power BI courses is a great choice
feel free to continue down that path. 
Just keep me posted on your progress!
[5/22/25, 3:02:20 PM] ~ 🔕: Thanks a lot 👍
[5/22/25, 3:02:37 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Let me know if you’d like recommendations for specific BI courses too.
[5/22/25, 3:03:08 PM] ~ Awais: Not mandatory but you should complete it and remain active.
I would recommend, you can speed up by focusing on just 1, either on powerbi or tableau, both are entirely different and take many months to master, and chances  are, 90% of times you just need one tool at your company
[5/22/25, 3:23:34 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Hey everyone,
We’ve sent DataCamp invitations to all active participants from the previous cycle as well as new participants who completed the form.

If you haven’t received an invitation yet, don’t worry — we are still sending out invitations, but if you were inactive in the previous cycle or didn’t fill out the form, you won’t get one this time. This is because we have limited seats available.

We will be monitoring participation closely, so please stay engaged and complete the necessary steps to secure your spot in future rounds.

[7/14/25, 12:50:58 PM] Sualeha Junaid Core Team Member: I checked your license status and it is active. The course you are trying to access is available as well. It is likely an issue on your end. Make sure you are logging in from the account the license has been provided to. You can try opening the course in a different browser, or logging out and back in to your DataCamp account.
