I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a change in the email address associated with my recent membership renewal. Due to an error, the renewal was registered under sqayyum425@gmail.com. However, my original account and ongoing courses are linked to cs201120@dsu.edu.pk.

I have completed several courses and currently have ongoing ones under the cs201120@dsu.edu.pk account, which I intend to complete. Could you please assist by transferring my renewed membership to this correct account? This would ensure continuity in my learning progress and access to my course history.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your help in resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Warm regards,

Sajjad Qayyum

[7/14/24, 11:27:13 AM] Mahnoor Ahmed GD: Dear DataCamp Aspirants,

If you're experiencing difficulties accessing your DataCamp subscriptions, it is likely because your subscriptions have been revoked after receiving a clear warning and a 10-day notice. Please fill out the form below and wait for the shortlisting process.

As the new GDG lead, I will be managing your DataCamp accounts so I will also be monitoring your activity to ensure these accounts are being utilized effectively. For accounts that remain inactive, we will be revoking access and offering this opportunity to other students who are passionate and eager to use it.
If you do not use your account by 10th October 2024, it will be revoked to make room for others who are committed to learning.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

I wanted to remind you about the email you’ve received regarding the assignment on ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers is that it’s a straightforward task. Just complete the course by 20/10/24. If you've already completed the course, you can skip it.

For those of you excelling in other areas and if this course doesn't align with your current interests, no worries! Keep up the fantastic work in the projects and initiatives you're involved in.

[10/19/24, 3:11:55 AM] ~ Ahmed Samir: Since LLMs are deterministic, it should be clear how exercises on DataCamp were graded, even if we slightly write different words or in the exercises that asked for our own inputs. How were these exactly graded? I am not sure I understand the comparison between the outputs for grading, and the final output wouldn't be the same every time, despite LLMs being deterministic in nature as models.
[10/19/24, 10:28:43 PM] ~ Awais: Is doing OpenAI course necessary for chatgpt prompt engineering course?

[1/29/25, 7:07:09 PM] Mahnoor Ahmed GD: Hey everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to share that I am stepping down from my role as the administrator of our DataCamp community. After a year and a half of dedication to this initiative, it’s a bittersweet moment for me.

Building this space alongside all of you has been an incredibly fulfilling journey. From curating learning opportunities to ensuring that every member had access to valuable resources, I’ve always strived to make this community a supportive and enriching environment. Seeing so many of you grow, collaborate, and make the most of this platform has been the biggest reward.

As I step away, the administration of DataCamp operations will now be handled by Umer Noor and Sualeha Junaid. I hope you continue to engage, learn, and make the most of this community under their guidance.

While I may no longer be managing things on the admin side, I truly hope the spirit of this community continues to thrive. Thank you to everyone who made this experience so meaningful—I’ve learned just as much from you as you have from DataCamp! Wishing you all continued success in your learning journeys.

This isn’t goodbye, just a change of roles. Keep learning and keep growing! 

Best,
Mahnoor

InshaAllah hope to see you on even greater heights than you are right now!
Thanks for all your efforts towards Datacamp and the events!
[1/29/25, 11:37:52 PM] ~ Dan: I'd like to ask something from the admins,
Mahnoor has stepped down from the role but
I wonder why such a brilliant and helpful person has been removed from the group?
[1/29/25, 11:47:52 PM] ~ Shahzaib: People who already have access should apply again as well?
[1/29/25, 11:56:34 PM] Datacamp GDGoc@DSU: ‎You changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group
[1/29/25, 11:59:31 PM] Qirrat: Thank you for sharing your kind words and appreciation for Mahnoor’s contributions. She has truly been an integral part of GDG and has made a significant impact with her hard work and dedication ❤️ 

As an organization, we respect the privacy and confidentiality of our team members, and therefore, we refrain from discussing internal matters publicly. We wish Mahnoor all the best in her future endeavors and are confident she will continue to achieve great things.

We’ll soon be opening up new registrations for DataCamp. However, before that happens, we need to revoke inactive accounts to make room for active users.

If you haven’t started using the platform yet, you have about a week to get involved and commit to it. Otherwise, your account will be deactivated.

Make sure to log in and start learning to retain your access!

[5/22/25, 2:58:00 PM] ~ 🔕: Is completing the course mandatory?

Actually I'm more interested in business intelligence for now, so would be working on Tableau and PowerBI courses
[5/22/25, 3:01:41 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Thanks for letting me know
that’s totally fine!
The Deep Learning course isn’t mandatory, it’s more of a general upskilling opportunity for anyone interested.
[5/22/25, 3:02:02 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Since you're focused on Business Intelligence, working on Tableau and Power BI courses is a great choice
feel free to continue down that path. 
Just keep me posted on your progress!
[5/22/25, 3:02:20 PM] ~ 🔕: Thanks a lot 👍
[5/22/25, 3:02:37 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Let me know if you’d like recommendations for specific BI courses too.
[5/22/25, 3:03:08 PM] ~ Awais: Not mandatory but you should complete it and remain active.
I would recommend, you can speed up by focusing on just 1, either on powerbi or tableau, both are entirely different and take many months to master, and chances  are, 90% of times you just need one tool at your company
[5/22/25, 3:23:34 PM] Umer noor Core Team: Hey everyone,
We’ve sent DataCamp invitations to all active participants from the previous cycle as well as new participants who completed the form.

If you haven’t received an invitation yet, don’t worry — we are still sending out invitations, but if you were inactive in the previous cycle or didn’t fill out the form, you won’t get one this time. This is because we have limited seats available.

We will be monitoring participation closely, so please stay engaged and complete the necessary steps to secure your spot in future rounds.

Thank you
[6/13/25, 7:34:01 PM] Sualeha Junaid Core Team Member: It won’t.
[6/13/25, 7:37:58 PM] Umer noor Core Team: You’re free to take other course, it’s not mandatory to stick to the assigned ones, and there will be no impact on your subscription. However, try to complete the assigned courses too, as they’re part of your learning plan.

We’ve completed the first round of activity checks for our DataCamp group.

Invitations that were not accepted by the deadline have now been revoked.
Members who remained inactive despite reminders have also been removed from the group.

Over the next 1 week, we’ll continue to monitor activity closely. Anyone who remains inactive during this period will also be removed to make space for more engaged learners.

After this week, we’ll be opening up new subscription slots, so stay active if you want to retain access and encourage your friends to stay tuned for updates!

Let’s stay consistent and committed to learning!

I hope this message finds you well. I am trying to access the Microsoft Fabric course on DataCamp, but I’m receiving the following message:
“Warning: Access to this course has been restricted by your organization.”

Could you please look into this and grant me access to the course if possible? It is relevant to my current learning objectives and professional development.

[7/14/25, 12:52:47 PM] Sualeha Junaid Core Team Member: Hi. this course appears restricted on our end as well due to organization’s setting. We will look into it further.
[7/14/25, 12:50:58 PM] Sualeha Junaid Core Team Member: I checked your license status and it is active. The course you are trying to access is available as well. It is likely an issue on your end. Make sure you are logging in from the account the license has been provided to. You can try opening the course in a different browser, or logging out and back in to your DataCamp account.
[7/14/25, 4:29:16 PM] ~ Ek: Thank you, Ma'am I will do as you guided me
